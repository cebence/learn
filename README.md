Learning programming hands-on using the Java programming language
===============

This repository holds miscellaneous Java snippets and projects that have been created mainly to illustrate
specific programming aspects, and features, and design/implementation issues I came across and found
potentialy interesting to other developers, especially those that are beginning their Computer/Information
Technology student courses.

Welcome.
