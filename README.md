# Welcome

This repository holds learning/teaching materials on miscellaneous Computer and Information Technology (IT) subjects, e.g. programming in Java&trade; or JavaScript/EcmaScript, accessing data with SQL, designing web pages with HTML and CSS, etc.

You will also find snippets and/or projects that illustrate a specific aspect or design or an issue I came across and found potentialy interesting to others, especially those beginning their IT studies.

I don't know about you, but I hate it when a guide/tutorial/article I am following doesn't produce the expected result and I can't find why. That's why I try to be as specific and detailed as possible so you could always have something to show for at the end - and I don't mean a [broken keyboard/monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN37Fn3Hw8E) ;-)
